   * actually might not be.  (And so |waitpid(-1)| should be
   * used to schedule the next task.)
   *
   * This is needed to handle the peculiarities of mass Task
   * death at exit_group() and upon receiving core-dumping
   * signals.  The reason it's needed is easier to understand if
   * you keep in mind that the "main loop" of ptrace tracers is
   * /supposed/ to look like
   *
   *   while (true) {
   *     int tid = waitpid(-1, ...);
   *     // do something with tid
   *     ptrace(tid, PTRACE_SYSCALL, ...);
   *   }
   *
   * That is, the tracer is supposed to let the kernel schedule
   * threads and then respond to notifications generated by the
   * kernel.
   *
   * Obviously this isn't how rr's recorder loop looks, because,
   * among other things, rr has to serialize thread execution.
   * Normally this isn't much of a problem.  However, mass task
   * death is an exception.  What happens at a mass task death
   * is a sequence of events like the following
   *
   *  1. A task calls exit_group() or is sent a core-dumping
   *     signal.
   *  2. rr receives a PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT notification for the
   *     task.
   *  3. rr detaches from the dying/dead task.
   *  4. Successive calls to waitpid(-1) generate additional
   *     PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT notifications for each also-dead task
   *     in the original task's thread group.  Repeat (2) / (3)
   *     for each notified task.
   *
   * So why destabilization?  After (2), rr can't block on the
   * task shutting down (|waitpid(tid)|), because the kernel
   * harvests the LWPs of the dying task group in an unknown
   * order (which we shouldn't assume, even if we could guess
   * it).  If rr blocks on the task harvest, it will (usually)
   * deadlock.
   *
   * And because rr doesn't know the order of tasks that will be
   * reaped, it doesn't know which of the dying tasks to
   * "schedule".  If it guesses and blocks on another task in
   * the group's status-change, it will (usually) deadlock.
   *
   * So destabilizing a task group, from rr's perspective, means
   * handing scheduling control back to the kernel and not
   * trying to harvest tasks before detaching from them.
   *
   * NB: an invariant of rr scheduling is that all process
   * status changes happen as a result of rr resuming the
   * execution of a task.  This is required to keep tracees in
   * known states, preventing events from happening "behind rr's
   * back".  However, destabilizing a task group means that
   * these kinds of changes are possible, in theory.
   *
   * Currently, instability is a one-way street; it's only used
   * needed for death signals and exit_group().

   * scratch deterministically, and when A (in the example

   * back to the original buffers, serializing A and B in the

   * and B.  In linux, B won't actually re-enter A; A is exited

   * assumption is that the kernel writes its (in)outparams
   * atomically wrt signal interruptions, and only writes them
   * on successful exit.  Each syscall will complete in stack
   * order, and it's invariant that the syscall processors must
   * only write back to user buffers *only* the data that was
   * written by the kernel.  So as long as the atomicity
   * assumption holds, the completion of syscalls higher in the
   * event stack may overwrite scratch space, but the completion
   * of each syscall will overwrite those overwrites again, and
